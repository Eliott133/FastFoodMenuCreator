# FastFoodMenuCreator

FastFoodMenuCreator is a web application designed to help restaurant owners, especially those managing fast food, create and manage their menu catalog. The application provides an intuitive interface for building a personalized menu, which can then be visualized and exported for use in digital kiosks, like those found in fast food restaurants such as McDonald's. This allows owners to quickly configure and deploy their menu for customer use.

## Features

1. **Visualize Menu**: Allows users to create and preview their menu in a kiosk-like interface to see how it would appear on a digital ordering screen.
2. **Catalog Creation**: Users can add, edit, and organize food items, categories, and prices to build their custom catalog.
3. **Export Functionality**: Once the menu is created, it can be exported to different formats for deployment on various systems (e.g., JSON, CSV).
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to replicate the fast-food ordering experience for a seamless transition to deployment.
